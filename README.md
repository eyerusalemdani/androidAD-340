HW2 UI Layout

  Let's liven up your application with some more visual elements and interactivity on the main screen.

Add a text entry field and 'send' button to your main activity.
The text field should have fixed spacing to the left edge of the screen and to the button on its right. Field width should vary according to screen size. The button should have fixed spacing on its right to the screen edge.
Add a 2 x 2 grid of buttons below the text entry field.

Each button should have unique text. The left edge of the grid should be aligned with the text field and right edge should be have a equal amount of spacing with the right edge of the screen. Spacing between each column of buttons should vary according to screen size,

Enable each button with a click event, where tapping the button displays a 'toast' with the text of that button. 

UI elements should be fully visible on a range of phone screen sizes.

Text strings should be defined in a resource file separate from your layout elements.
